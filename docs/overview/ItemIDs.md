# ItemIDs

## Background on `ItemID`s

In many other project systems, `ItemID`s are actually raw memory pointers -- 
opaque to the caller but meaningful within a project system, sort of like 
a `VSCOOKIE`. If someone held onto an `ItemId` beyond its invalidation, and 
then passed that `ItemId` into the project system, the project system might 
dereference it and end up crashing the product because of an access violation. 
It has therefore always been critical for anyone with an `ItemId` to not use 
it after the item it represents is destroyed.

### When can `ItemID`s be destroyed?

`ItemID`s can *only* be destroyed on the UI thread. 

When destroying them, a project system is obliged to raise an
`IVsHierarchyEvent::OnItemDeleted` event notifying listeners of that item's
demise. In fact, `OnItemDeleted` is called just before destroying the `ItemID`,
which gives event handlers a chance to ask questions about the `ItemID` one
last time before it is impossible to do so.

This is true not just for native project systems that only operate on
the UI thread. It's true by the undocumented, de facto rule that that is
where they have always been destroyed. And since the only way for clients
to be notified of an `ItemId` invalidation is on the UI thread, a client on
the UI thread that has not been notified of an invalidation must be able
to assume it is therefore safe to pass that `ItemId` back to the project
system. We can't have project systems issuing `ItemId`s, then invalidating
them on background threads while the poor client on the UI thread is about
to hand it back to the project system now, can we? ;-p

### How can a client be sure an `ItemID` has not been destroyed?

The simplest way is to never store them, and always obtain them on the UI
thread. For example, this code is always safe (when executed on the main
thread):

```csharp
  int rootFirstChildItemId;

  ErrorHandler.ThrowOnFailure(hierarchy.GetProperty(
      VSConstants.VSITEMID_Root,
      VSHPROPID_FirstChild,
      out rootFirstChildItemId));

  int nextSiblingItemId;

  ErrorHandler.ThrowOnFailure(hierarchy.GetProperty(
      rootFirstChildItemId,
      VSHPROPID_NextSibling,
      out nextSiblingItemId));

  // ...
```

The above code is safe because:

- It passes `ItemID`s to the project system that it just barely obtained.
  Nothing could have occurred in between the steps of acquisition and
  reuse to invalidate the `ItemId`.
- The code does not mutate the project in any way. 
- The code is executing on the UI thread.
    
#### FAQ

- **COM STA rules will marshal all my calls to the UI thread for me. 
    Why must I be on the UI thread if dealing with ItemIds?**
  - If you're on a background thread, the call into `IVsHierarchy` will 
    only get marshaled to the UI thread if that particular project system
    implementation is a native COM STA object. Calls to a project system
    implemented in managed code will generally not marshal to the UI thread.
    But even if marshaling did occur, it's still not safe. Remember that
    between the call where you acquire the ItemID and reuse it, you're no
    longer on the UI thread and thus other code could be on the UI thread
    mutating the project. And if that's the case, then the ItemID that you
    just obtained may have been destroyed and you wouldn't know about it.
- **What if I'm mutating the project? Could the ItemID be invalidated then?**
  - Yes. Obviously if you ask the project to delete a file represented
    by that `ItemID`, that `ItemID` will likely be destroyed immediately. But
    even seemingly benign mutations could invalidate an `ItemID`. E.g.,
    setting a project property could cause `ItemID`s to be destroyed (if the
    MSBuild project file beneath the project defines an item conditionally
    based on that property, for example). 

### How can a client be notified when an `ItemID` is destroyed?

If you must store an `ItemID` longer than you directly control the main
thread, you must take steps to ensure that you destroy that `ItemID` when
the project system does. 

Call `IVsHierarchy::AdviseHierarchyEvents` passing in your implementation
of `IVsHierarchyEvents`. When an `ItemId` is destroyed, either of two things
will happen:

- `IVsHierarchyEvents::OnItemDeleted` will be raised with the `ItemId` to be 
  destroyed.
- `IVsHierarchyEvents::OnInvalidateItems` will be raised on some ancestor 
  of the `ItemID`, which at this point may or may not be destroyed. You have 
  to assume that it's destroyed and rediscover the current `ItemId` by 
  getting the project system to give it to you again.

#### FAQ

- **Why doesn't the project system just offer a simple and safe way to check
  whether an ItemID is still valid, so I don't have to deal with this event
  handler stuff?**
  - Even if there were a safe way to simply ask the project system if an
    `ItemID` were valid before using it, that would be imprecise since a
    destroyed `ItemID` can be recycled to represent a different item in which
    case it would be valid, but not have the same significance that your code
    may apply to it.
    So really the "is this `ItemId` valid?" query is not the one your code would
    need to be asking. Rather, it would be "Is this `ItemId` valid, and does it
    represent foo.cs?" 
- **Then how can store state regarding an item without dealing with event 
  handlers?**
  - Instead of storing `ItemId`s, store the item moniker. Then, whenever you
    need the `ItemId`, you obtain it using the moniker:
     ```csharp
     IVsHierarchy::GetCanonicalName(itemid, out moniker)
     IVsHierarchY::ParseCanonicalName(moniker, out itemid)
     ```

## What is unique about CPS and `ItemID`s?

CPS isn't a project system written in native code, so we don't use pointers
for our `ItemId`s. We just use an incrementing integer. Since `ItemId`s are
to be treated as opaque values, this shouldn't make any difference to you.
But one thing it does mean is that if you pass in an invalid `ItemId`, CPS
won't crash the product, but CPS will throw an exception back at you. 

It so happens that the C#, VB, and C++ project systems don't change their
`ItemId`s very often. In fact, they almost never do. A file moved within a
project tends to keep its `ItemId`. This is an implementation detail of a
project system and nothing that anyone outside should count on. But we've
found that some folks do. They don't listen to events, and they assume an
`ItemId` is valid forever. 

CPS has a greater tendency to change `ItemId`s for project items and open
documents than earlier project systems. For example, during a file move
or rename there is a very good chance the `ItemId` will change. This means
that clients that were previously tested on the legacy C# project system
may need to be re-tested when run against CPS and fixed to be more careful
when handling `ItemId`s.
