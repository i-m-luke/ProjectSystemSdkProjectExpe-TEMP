Block/Defer critical project operations
=======================================

You can block critical project operations (Build, Save, Rename,
Unload) until specified tasks complete by registering your tasks via
`IProjectAsynchronousTasksService`.

`RegisterAsyncTask()` with a `ProjectCriticalOperation` flag is provided
to support this:

```csharp    
void RegisterAsyncTask(JoinableTask joinableTask, ProjectCriticalOperation operationFlags, bool registerFaultHandler = false)
```

E.g., if you want to defer the build, you can register your tasks that you
want to wait on for build by passing in `ProjectCriticalOperation.Build` as
the flag.

For closing project, we provide a `CancellationToken` you can use to bail
out quickly instead of blocking project close for a long time.
